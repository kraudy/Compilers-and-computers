HSA: heterogeous system architecture
tries to reduce latency between cpu and gpu communicaiton
it does it by trying to use the same memory devices cuz access time to another disjoint
memory device takes too much time, i think, what u think?.

HSA allows programs to use the GPU for floating-point operations 
# i don't know if that is any good, they don't say it either. But they can do it.

DSP: Digital signal processor
Architecture specialized for digital signal processing
