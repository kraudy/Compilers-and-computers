Notes about all electronic related stuff

MOSFET: metal-oxyde-semiconductor field-effect transistor 
# try remembering that!
A MOSFET is a kind of transistor!
# why the hell they don't say that in the definition?
# yeah, they do say it...

FET: field-effect-transistor they involve single carrier operation (uniporlar, unlike
BJT -bipolar junction transistor): n-channel or p-channel
There are 2 kinds of FET: 
  JFET (junction gate)  : 3 terminal semiconductor
  IGFET (insulated gate): 4 terminal semiconductor

NMOS
CMOS

high-k

Extrinsic semiconductor = doped semiconductor
doped = Intentional introduction of impurities into a semiconductor

** This is why semiconductors are important: Their conductivity can be manipulated over
many orders of magnitude by doping

Semiconductor doping: Changes an intrinsic semiconductor to an extrinsic one

Increasing the electron carrier concentration(nO) makes the semicunductor n-type
Increasing the hole carrier concentration (pO) creates a p-type semiconductor

diode: allows current in one direction -> consists of p-type and n-type semiconductors 
placed in junction

n-type -> has excess of electrons | n -> negative
p-type -> has excess of holes     | p -> positive

Transistors: Is a semiconductor that enables current switching # on/off kinda thing
It has 3 terminals
