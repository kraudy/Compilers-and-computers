Is the way a given ISA is implemented in a particular processo
The same ISA can be implemented with many microarchitecture

To run programs, all single or multi chip CPUs:
  - Read an instruction and decode it
  - Find any associated data that is needed to process the instruction
  - Process the instruction
  - Write the results out

ISAs:
  - VLIW : very long instruction word
  - EPIC : explicitly paraller instruction computing 

  - SIMD : single instruction, multiple data
  - Vectors: vector processor

  - CISC : complex intstruction set computer
  - RISC : reduced instruction set computer

RISC-V separates each stage of the instruction process and making them take one cycle
