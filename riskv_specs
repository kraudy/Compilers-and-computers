RISC-V ISA modules:
  RV32I
  RV32E
  RV64I
  RV128I

Extension: M, A, F, D, Q, L, C, B, J, T, P, V, N

Avoids over-architecting for a particular microarchitecture

There are two primary base integer variants:
  - RV32I
  - RV64I

RV32E is a variant or RV32I for small microcontrollers

The base integer ISA is named "I", and contains:
  - Integer computaional instructions
  - Integer load
  - Integer stores
  - Control flow instructions
* And is mandatory for all RISC-V implementations

Extensions:
  - M : multiplication and division
