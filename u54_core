PMP : physical memory protection

U5 processor core:
  - Instruction memory system
  - Instruction fetch system
  - Execution pipeline
  - Floating point unit
  - Data memory system
  - Memory management unit
  - Support for global, software and timer interrupts

Features:
  - ISA -> RV64GC
  - Instruction Cache -> 16 KiB 8-way instruction cache
  - Instruction tightly integrated memory -> ITIM max size 16 KiB
  - Data cache -> 16 KiB 8-way data cache
  - ECC Support -> 
  - Virtual memory support -> Support for Sv39 virtual memory support with a 39-bit visual
address sapce, 64-bit physical address space, and a 32-entry TLB
  - Modes -> Machine mode, Supervisor mode, User mode


Instruction fetch unit:
  Contains a branch predictor: BTB (branch target buffer), -> predictes target of taken branche
                               BHT (branch history table) -> predicts direction of 
                                                             conditional branches
                               RAS (return address stack) -> predicts the target of 
                                                             procedure returns

Execution Pipeline: single-issue, in-order pipeline
The pipeline comprises five stages:
  - Instruction fetch
  - Instruction decode and register fetch
  - execute
  - data memory access
  - register writeback

Branch and jump instructions transfer control from the memory access pipeline stage

The load-reserved and sotore-conditional instructions are only supported on cached regions

MMU: Memory Management Unit
The U5 MMU has 64 virtual address space mapped to 64 physicla address space.
A hardware page-table walker refiils the address transaltion caches

PLIC  = Platform-level interrupt controller
CLINT = Core-local interruptor

BEU = Bus error unit

Level 2 cache controller: used to provide access to fast copies of memory for masters in a
core complex
