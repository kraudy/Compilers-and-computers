Microcode
intermediary between hardware (cpu) and ISA 

It consists of a series of microinstructions which control the cpu at a fundametal level
of hardware circuitry
Microcode only runs on the exact electronic circuitry for wich it is designed

It seems like microcode is lower than assembly

Hardware -> binary -> microcode -> assm -> C

Microcode -> developed for the control logic of a computer

Instruction sets were hardwired

Instruction pipelining:

Cache:

Branch prediction:

Out-of-order execution: allows a ready instruction to be processed while an older 
intruction waits

Register renaming:
